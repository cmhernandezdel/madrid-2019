Bag of words algorithm with every major candidate program.

<h2> What is a bag of words algorithm? </h2>
A bag of words algorithm (or model) is a very graphic way of presenting text data using machine learning algorithms. 

These algorithms take a corpus, which is the text to analyze, and count the unique words contained in it. The algorithm must ignore capitalization, punctuation, stop words (words that provide no information) and can even reduce words to their stem.

Then, this algorithm returns a graphic which shows the most used terms in the text.

<h2> Is this a bag of words model? </h2>
This is not a real bag of words model, however it is a quick script that gets the most used words in a text, supresses punctuation, stop words, etc. It is an unique way of getting a quick glance about the Madrid politics and what each local political party defends.
